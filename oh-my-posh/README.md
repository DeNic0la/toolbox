# Oh My Posh

[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) is a prompt theme engine for any shell. It allows you to create beautiful and informative prompts that can display various information such as the current directory, git status, and more.

I use it since its OS and Shell agnostic, and it works on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It supports various shells like PowerShell, Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
